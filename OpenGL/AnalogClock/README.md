# Analog Clock
Implemented in my fourth year of Computer Science


Main Characteristics:
    
    - The whole clock fits on the unit sphere
    
    - Regardless of the size of the window, the unit sphere touches the upper
        and lower limits of the drawing area while maintaining isometry
        
    - Animation is temporally consistent (independent of processor speed)
    
    - The following changes are perceived:
        + An object is continuously moving
        + An object changes every second
        + An object changes every minute
        + An object changes every hour
        
    - In addition, whenever there is a change in the hour value, most of 
        the information is hidden to facilitate the appreciation of the time.
